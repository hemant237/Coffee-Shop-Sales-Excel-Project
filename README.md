# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project involves creating a dynamic and interactive sales analysis dashboard for a coffee shop chain using Excel. The dashboard provides actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product popularity across different locations and times.

## Project Overview
### Business Problem
The coffee shop chain wanted to:
1. Identify peak hours and days for sales.
2. Understand product category preferences and their contribution to revenue.
3. Analyze footfall and revenue distribution across different store locations.
4. Determine the top-performing products and evaluate order size patterns.

### Approach
- **Data Preparation**: Raw sales and customer data were cleaned and organized for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Interactive slicers (month and day filters) were incorporated to make the dashboard user-friendly.
- **Key Metrics Analyzed**:
  - Total sales, footfall, average bill per person, and average order per person.
  - Hourly and weekday sales trends.
  - Product and category-based sales distribution.
  - Location-wise footfall and revenue.
  - Top-performing products and order size distribution.

### Key Insights
1. **Peak Hours**: Most orders occur between 9 AM and 11 AM, making it the busiest period.
2. **Top Product**: The "Barista Espresso" is the highest-selling product, contributing $91,406.20 in sales.
3. **Category Preference**: Tea accounts for the highest share of sales (39%), followed by Coffee (28%).
4. **Store Performance**: "Hell's Kitchen" location generates the highest revenue ($2,36,511.17) despite slightly lower footfall compared to others.
5. **Order Size Patterns**: Regular-sized orders dominate the sales distribution at 31%.

### Positive Impact
The dashboard enables stakeholders to:
- Strategically allocate resources during peak hours.
- Focus on promoting high-revenue products like "Barista Espresso."
